# RyMarc-s-Painting-Service

The purpose of the website is to be an online version of a traditional painting service. Traditionally, customers would call the boss to schedule an appointment to get their home painted, then the boss would have to visit the house to give an estimate, such as supplies cost, labor cost, time needed to finish, etc. This website will provide this service and more, as customers can create accounts, request an estimate for the job, submit forms that explain the details of the job, provide and view feedback, etc.
